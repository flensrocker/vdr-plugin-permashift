VDR Plugin 'permashift' Revision History
---------------------------------------------------

2013-04-03: Version 0.5.3

- Length of permanent timeshift recording wasn't restored on restart; 
  thanks to MegaX at vdr-portal for finding the bug

2013-03-30: Version 0.5.2

- Length of permanent timeshift recording changeable by user between 1 and 23 hours.
- i18n implemented, translated user visible strings to German.

2013-01-19: Version 0.5.1

- Moved stuff to allow automatic shutdown from VDR patch to plugin.
  Now the plugin asks the user if it should continue to record if he has been inactive too long.
  If the user does not react, permanent timeshift is stopped (thus markad stops to work at its 
  recording as well) and shutdown may take place. Thanks to mini73 at VDR Portal for his suggestions.

2013-01-05: Version 0.5.0beta2

- Initial public revision.
